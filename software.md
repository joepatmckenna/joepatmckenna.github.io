Here is a list of software that I've worked on:

- [`normal_forms`](../normal_forms/html/) - A Python package for computing normal forms of autonomous differential equations.

- [`scRutiNy`](http://lbm.niddk.nih.gov/mckennajp/scRutiNy) - A Python package for analyzing and simulating single-cell RNA sequencing data.
