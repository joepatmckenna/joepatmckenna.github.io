Here is a list of software that I've worked on:

- [`normal_forms`](../normal_forms/html/) - A Python package for computing normal forms of autonomous differential equations.

- [`scRutiNy`](http://lbm.niddk.nih.gov/mckennajp/scRutiNy) - A Python package for analyzing and simulating single-cell RNA sequencing data.

- [Fortran guide](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~jmckenna/acm-computing-seminar/resources/langs/fortran/) - A guided intended to get the reader quickly up-and-running with scientific computing in modern Fortran.
